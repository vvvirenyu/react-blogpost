        Pull out your heart to make the being alone (yeah)
        Easy, easy (talkin' to my younger self)
        Pull out your heart to make the being alone
        Dear Gerald, you're fourteen years and a truant
        You're trying to find your place, and figure out where you fit
        You're finna start rappin' with a kid you went to school with
        But, more on that later, right now you're going through it
        See, you're going to have to prove that you ain't soft and you ain't stupid
        And you gon' have to scrap with some kids that you ain't cool with
        You got a short temper, just be careful when you lose it
        You wanna be the man, but it's gon' take some time to prove it
        You'll fall in love, but she's gon' break your heart and put you through it
        Fuck falling for that bullshit, you gon' fall in love with music
        You're finna get arrested, almost fuck around and lose it
        Spend days in juvy standing at the window, looking through it
        Nothing in life is promised, not even free-time is
        So, only chase dreams, and only chase commas
        Won't happen on its own, trust, trust, we've been through it
        If it was easy, everyone would do it
        This game is not
        Easy, easy (Eazy)
        Pull out your heart to make the being alone
        I mean, I was fucking up
        I was seventeen, I was eighteen, just doing dumb shit
        My moms made me move to New Orleans and shit, I went to school down there on a scholarship
        I finally got my shit together, I started taking music seriously
        Then it started to kinda pop off a little bit, almost
        Dear Gerald, 21, you think you've got it figured out
        Got a big head from them labels trying to bring you out
        'Til they passed on you, they ain't see what they was missing out
        On, that flight home gave you some shit to think about
        Scrambling trying to figure out, went back to the drawing board
        Know they say rejection's only supposed to make you want it more
        But, no lie, you contemplating quitting, walking out the door
        But, what the fuck you supposed to do? This is all you're living for
        Really it was that and Dev, that was all you had
        Paying rent by engineering other rappers at the pad
        Barely getting by, hella broke, you was doing bad
        Then "These Things Happened", you finally seen a bag
        You drove down the highway, a fork in the road
        A normal life with her, or going for broke?
        I seen an open lane and I drove straight through it
        If it was easy, everyone would do it
        This game is not
        Easy, easy
        I literally sold all my shit
        I moved out of my place in New Orleans
        I was bouncing around, living out of a suitcase
        Crashing on friends' couches
        Living at AirBnbs, hotels
        Trying to make the album
        Trying to make When It's Dark Out
        And take it there and be great
        Dear Gerald, life changed since you dropped your second album
        And Me, Myself & I just went 7x Platinum
        Toured around the world, damn, you really had 'em
        But now you're 27 and it's time to be a legend
        Back when it all started, grinding hard on that promo tour
        Tired from the night before and the night before and the night before
        Fuck it, tomorrow, gotta fly some more
        Don't complain, this is what you signed up for
        You're working for your family, managers, agents
        They all want something different from you, tell 'em all patience
        But, this one's on you, the lonely quest of greatness
        Been trying to be famous, been trying to be A-list
        When you arrive, it will appear as if there's nothing to it
        But, you planted the seeds and you grew it
        There's people taking credit for success that they had nothing to do with
        If it was easy, everyone would do it
        This game is not
        Easy, easy (Eazy)
        Pull out your heart to make the being alone
        Easy, easy
        So now you're here
        What you gon' do with it?
        You know?
        Yeah, uh, make no mistake, listen it's the life that I was chosen for
        All I prayed for was an open door
        I've been rich, I've been broke before
        I've seen the floor
        You try to put me in a box, I'll box out like Okafor
        And fuck being indecisive now I'm so for sure
        And fuck Trump, it's like "What the fuck we voted for?"
        And most of y'all should probably party less and focus more
        And if that line resonates, you're probably who I wrote it for
        Where will I go from here? "IDK"
        They want me to architect Rome, in a day
        Juice knew I was greatness when he looked at me
        Right away, I've made platinum records that'll never see the light of day
        This is what the whole world's been waiting for
        The crowd's jumping, going dumb 'til they break the floor
        Come take a walk inside my mind, come and take a tour
        I'm really not playing, what the fuck you take me for?
        Easy, easy
        Pull out your heart to make the being alone
        Where, where, can I not
        Easy
        Pull out your heart to make the being alone
        Easy
        Easy
        Easy
        Easy`

        So the bar is where I go
        Me and my friends at the table doing shots
        Drinking fast and then we talk slow
        Come over and start up a conversation with just me
        And trust me I'll give it a chance now
        Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox

        Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
        We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
        And how your family is doing okay
